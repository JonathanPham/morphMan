Code
- Clean up the code using in move branches
- Make into a module
- curvature__ ?

Notes for the future
- Replace for-loops with numpy_support in vtk
- Generalize functions which wrapes vtk objects by exposing more agruments in the function
- Restructure the code into: centerline_operations.py, voronoi_operations.py,
  surface_operations io.py, etc. There are now overlapping functionalty in the code.
