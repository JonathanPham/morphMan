Code
- Clean up the code using in move branches
- Consistent order of the "main" function
- Make into a module
- Consistent code under __init__ == "__main__"
- Remove "operator"..?
- ifile/ofile as parameter (mandatory)
- sort argpars arguments
- add initialize as an argument
- curvature__ ?

Functionality
- Post-processing of the surface with clipping and
  light smoothing with laplace, and testing 'merge'

Testing/tutorial
- Download data from somewhere

Notes for the future
- Replace for-loops with numpy_support in vtk
- Set resolution, not number in polyball size using bounds of the Voronoi diagram
- Generalize functions which wrapes vtk objects by exposing more agruments in the function
- Restructure the code into: centerline_operations.py, voronoi_operations.py,
  surface_operations io.py, etc. There are now overlapping functionalty in the code.
