Formaleties
- Add a README file, like the one in Oasis
- Add tags to the repository

- Add a badge for building on Travis CI
- Add a licence file, and a header to each file.
- Add the original licence header to vmtkpointselector

Notes for the future
- Replace for-loops with numpy_support in vtk
- Generalize functions which wrapes vtk objects by exposing more agruments in the function
- Restructure the code into: centerline_operations.py, voronoi_operations.py,
  surface_operations io.py, etc. There are now overlapping functionalty in the code.
